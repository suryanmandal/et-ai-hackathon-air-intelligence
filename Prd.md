# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - VayuSense

## 1. Project Overview & Core Vision
VayuSense is an enterprise-grade Municipal Environmental Monitoring & Automated Regulatory Command Engine built for dense urban centers across India. The platform ingests real-time environmental metrics, automatically isolates emission source anomalies using advanced machine learning, and deploys legally binding automated compliance enforcement workflows through an autonomous multi-agent network across **277 Municipal Corporations in all 28 Indian States and Delhi UT**.

## 2. Targeted Users
*   **Municipal Command Directors (Clearance Level 4):** High-level regulatory officials (e.g., Dr. Abhijit K. Bhosale, IAS) managing city-wide environmental disaster strategies.
*   **Field Enforcement Officers:** Field teams executing statutory site closures or inspection updates using augmented reality data overlays.
*   **Audit Committees:** External legal and state boards verifying compliance dispatch logs using mathematically unalterable system metrics.

## 3. Core Features Map
*   **Pan-India Municipal Coverage:** Instant state and corporation selection covering all 28 Indian States (276 Corporations) + Delhi UT (MCD) with dynamic statutory PDF directory generation.
*   **3 Major Emission Factor Source Attribution:** Real-time GeoJSON spatial overlays categorizing urban pollution sources:
    1. **Industrial & Power Generation (50% Impact):** Yellow ▲ Triangle Zones ($\text{SO}_2, \text{NO}_x, \text{PM}_{2.5}, \text{Pb}$)
    2. **Transportation & Vehicular Exhaust (30% Impact):** Cyan ● Circle Corridors ($\text{NO}_2$, Black Carbon)
    3. **Construction & Road Dust (20% Impact):** Purple ■ Square Grids ($\text{PM}_{10}$)
*   **Satellite Raster Integration:** Sentinel-5P satellite plume layer highlighted in Electric Indigo (`#6366f1`) with pulsing telemetry badges (`📡`).
*   **Collapsible Big-Screen Map Viewport Controls:** Floating map control panel with interactive hamburger accordion toggle for big-screen GIS views.
*   **Autonomous Multi-Agent Audit Operations:** Agentic workflow execution, SHA-256 cryptographically signed logs, multi-lingual translation engines, and downloadable official municipal evidence dispatch PDFs.
*   **Developer & API Hub Portal:** Interactive documentation portal containing real-time code snippet sandboxes (cURL & Python), dynamic FastAPI Swagger integrations, and detailed technical walkthroughs.
*   **Regional Dialect Support & Search Bar**: Integrated translations for Bhojpuri (भोजपुरी), Maithili (मैथिली), Awadhi (अवधी), Odia (ଓଡ଼ିଆ), Rajasthani (राजस्थानी), Assamese (অসমীয়া), and Manipuri (মণিপুরী) with smart Bihar/UP automatic defaults and search capabilities.
*   **Level 4 Clearance PDF Exporters**: Built vector-based PDF report compilers across `/geospatial/vector`, `/geospatial/satellite`, and `/agent-logs/exporter` equipped with Dr. Abhijit K. Bhosale, IAS signatures, live PostGIS queries, and automated download streams.
*   **Interactive Command Header Controls**: Clickable logo redirecting to main control room (`/dashboard/home`), dynamic notification bell with pulsing unread alerts, and biometric officer ID popover cards.
